# Usage of abstraction plugin to CORA

The goal is to compute reachable set for provided bounds of state and input 
spaces and step. Result is stored as a json, example of usage in 
abstraction\examples\2RL_system. 
Needed CORA installation and adding \abstraction folder to the matlab path. 

The result can be used to solve control problem with scots [1] framework.
